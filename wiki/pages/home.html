    <p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that block translation or induce degradation of mRNA and thereby control patterns of gene expression. Acute myocardial infarction is a common cardiovascular event that results in cardiac remodelling and can consequently lead to the development of chronic heart failure.However, the current examination mechanism for myocardial infarction is either cumbersome and inconvenient, or slow to produce results and lack agilityIn our project, we developed a low-priced, portable, and fast test strip to detect miRNA and prevent myocardial infarction.</p>
    <p>Our technical route:The colloidal gold modifies the gene fragments of different hairpin structures, different gene fragments target different miRNAs, and the combination with miRNA triggers HCR thermostatic amplification reaction, and at the same time uses the reverse cleavage function of CRISPR technology to release fluorescent signals to complete miRNA detection, the project will combine colloidal gold technology, HCR thermostatic amplification technology and CRISPR reverse cleavage function to establish a specific method for detecting miRNA, and predict whether patients have myocardial infarction according to the detection results.</p>

    <h2>Styling your wik i</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Feel free to customize the page styling according to your preferences, or you can simply leave the style as it is. It's wise to focus on a clear content first, and on a clean design later.</p>
    <p>Be cautious with the size of the assets like images, videos, and more into your wiki. Large file sizes can hinder the presentation of wikis due to slow internet connections. Remember to compress large files before uploading them to iGEM servers.</p>
    <p>This default wiki meets the requirements, enhances navigability, and provides a user-friendly experience for visitors. You should not feel obliged to go beyond the provided styling.</p>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>This wiki will be your team's first interaction with the rest of the world, so here are a few tips to help you get started:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>State your accomplishments! Tell people what you have achieved from the start.</li>
      <li>Be clear about what you are doing and how you plan to do this.</li>
      <li>You have a global audience! Consider the different backgrounds that your users come from.</li>
      <li>Make sure information is easy to find; nothing should be more than 3 clicks away.</li>
      <li>Avoid using very small fonts and low contrast colors; information should be easy to read.</li>
      <li>Start documenting your project as early as possible; don't leave anything to the last minute before the Wiki Freeze. For a complete list of deadlines visit the <a href="https://competition.igem.org/calendar" target="_blank">iGEM Competition calendar</a></li>
      <li>Have lots of fun!</li>
